Train a model to compute the L2 Norm of a vector. The vector X has `n` data points.  L2 norm is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of the elements of the vector.
Once the model is trained, we should have the ability to provide a vector as input and the learned model should return the L2 Norm of the vector.

Constraints:
-10 <= x_i <= 10
1 <= n <= 100

Input format:
First line of the input file will be `n` and `m`, the size of each vector and the number of vectors respectively. Then, `m` lines follow, each with space separated elements of the i_th vector.

Output format:
Each line of the output should be the L2 norm of the corresponding vector returned by a model trained to compute L2 norm.
